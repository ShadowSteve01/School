<p> On this site I will be presenting my work from my portfolio, <br> I am a game design student working to become a level designer <br> and hoping to make some very progressive games in the future.</p>
<hl> About <span class="text-primary"> me</span></hl>
<p> I am a University student learning to make video games and trying to build up a small indie games company. <br>
I have trained in game design in college at Westherts College and now have joined Bournemouth University to continue <br>
my long journey into the industy. As many people can tell I am a huge fan of Doctor Who as it has inspired a lot <br>
of my choices throughout the years, many of my influences have been part of the show such as David Tennat, Russel T. Davis <br>
and Nicholas Briggs. In my spare time I like to create film media content and audio recordings that play tribute to <br>
the Doctor Who franchise and I do this in hopes to be employed by them. </p>
