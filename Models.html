<p style="text-align: right; color: #73ff7c; font-size: 20px" > These are some of the models I have created since the begining of lockdown, <br>
most of the models I had rendered where from my Blender exports when I was trying to lean how to use the program. <br>
Each render was a different experiment including modelling techniques, texturing adjustments, camera work and <br>
basing the model off a more realistic and accurate model.</p>
<img style="height: 350px; width: 600px " src="Sandcrawler Annotated.png" align="right">
<p style="font-size: 20px"> In the future I plan to make even more models to expand my skills of modelling, <br>
when I make more models I will be trying to expand out from just Daleks and try working <br>
on enviroments and artifacts such as buildings, cars, small discarded peices of trash <br>
and many more. I do use different techniques for modelling as well such as modelling from blueprints, <br>
box modelling, and somtimes extrusion modelling. I find both Extrustion and Box modelling are my, <br>
more prefered method of modelling and I have more skill in working in those areas, plus it's easier <br>
to use those techniques compared to spending lots of time searching for blueprints to go off. <br>
So I look forward to the future developments of my modelling and I can't wait to reveal any developments <br>
on this site. </p> 
<p> On the right is an image of a vechile I created for a modelling task/ competition in University, I call the <br>
finished product the Sandcrawler. When I designed the Sandcrawler I thought of making some form of vechile in <br>
a wasteland apocalypse or even to make some form of hover bike, I also liked the idea of making some form of motor cycle <br>
so I started making some designs by bashing a few shapes together. After finishing the basic geometry of the object I then <br>
started to extrude and combine the shapes together and made the basic form of the Sandcrawler. Then I went back over <br>
the model with boolean techniques and made some wires to cover some empty spaces using the Lattice tool over cylinders. <br>
Then I finished the model and later added a few extra details to the design including some scratches and some small references, <br>
such as a Captain America's sheild on the side of the machine. I would have liked to add some form of sculpting to the model <br>
and I would have liked to UV it but sadly the UV mesh was very big and would have taken a large portion of time to create. <br>
Overall I enjoyed the project and I think it came out with a decent result. </p>
